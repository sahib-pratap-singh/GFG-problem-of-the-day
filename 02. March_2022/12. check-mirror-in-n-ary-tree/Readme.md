<h1>:heavy_check_mark: Check Mirror in N-ary tree </h1>

<blockquote>
Given two n-ary trees. Check if they are mirror images of each other or not. You are also given e denoting the number of edges in both trees, and two arrays, A[] and B[]. Each array has 2*e space separated values u,v denoting an edge from u to v for the both trees.

* **Example 1**:<br>

                Input:
                n = 3, e = 2
                A[] = {1, 2, 1, 3}
                B[] = {1, 3, 1, 2}
                Output:
                1
                Explanation:
                  1          1
                 / \        /  \
                2   3      3    2 
                As we can clearly see, the second tree
                is mirror image of the first.

* **Example 2**:<br>

                Input:
                n = 3, e = 2
                A[] = {1, 2, 1, 3}
                B[] = {1, 2, 1, 3}
                Output:
                0
                Explanation:
                  1          1
                 / \        /  \
                2   3      2    3 
                As we can clearly see, the second tree
                isn't mirror image of the first.

**âž” Your Task**

     You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function checkMirrorTree() which takes 2 Integers n, and e;  and two arrays A[] and B[] of size 2*e as input and returns 1 if the trees are mirror images of each other and 0 if not.
