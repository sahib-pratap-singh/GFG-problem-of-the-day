<h1>:heavy_check_mark: Biconnected Graph </h1>

<blockquote>
Given a graph with n vertices, e edges and an array arr[] denoting the edges connected to each other, check whether it is Biconnected or not.
Note: The given graph is Undirected.
</blockquote>

* **Example 1**:<br>

            Input:
            n = 2, e = 1
            arr = {0, 1}
            Output:
            1
            Explanation:
                   0
                  /
                 1
            The above graph is Biconnected.

* **Example 2**:<br>

            Input:
            n = 3, e = 2
            arr = {0, 1, 1, 2}
            Output:
            0
            Explanation:
                   0
                  /
                 1
                  \
                   2
            The above graph is not Biconnected.

**âž” Your Task**

     You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function biGraph() which takes 2 Integers n, and e and an array arr of length 2*e as input and returns 1 if the graph is biconnected else returns 0.

### **Constraints** 

      1 <= e <= 100
      2 <= n <= 100
